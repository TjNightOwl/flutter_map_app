# flutter_map_app
This is a `flutter` project where i am making an app that uses Google maps to track location and display how far u are to multi points on the map but then 
I have an error in "flutter_map_app\map_app\lib\provider\location_provider.dart" on line 17, 48 & 49. something about null safe but i don't know how to go about it.
